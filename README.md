# RGettingAndCleaningData
Work for the course project for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data in R

The run_analysis.R script will process the unzipped UCI HAR Dataset and produce 
a data set that contains the average of variables dealing with means and standard 
deviations, grouped by subject and activity type.

The script depends on the dplyr packages and expects to find the unzipped UCI HAR 
Dataset in its working directory.
